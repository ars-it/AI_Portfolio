## Environment Variables

The portfolio uses environment variables to keep sensitive information secure:

- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_CONTENT`: The entire system prompt containing your personal information

**Security Note**: The `SYSTEM_PROMPT_CONTENT` contains all your personal information, background, and projects. This is kept in the `.env.local` file (which is gitignored) to prevent it from being exposed in the repository.
